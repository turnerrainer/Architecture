# Architectural Decision Record (ADR) for Data Pipeline

## ADR-001: Modularity and Scalability

### **Context**
The "Data Pipeline" must handle diverse ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows while being adaptable to new requirements such as additional data sources or increased data volumes. Flexibility and scalability are essential for maintaining performance and reducing development overhead.

### **Decision**
- Separate the ETL process into distinct modular components: data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- Enable plug-and-play connectors for each module to support multiple data sources and targets (e.g., databases, APIs, files).
- Design for horizontal scalability to handle increased data volumes and parallel processing.

### **Consequences**
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new data sources or transformations without impacting existing components.
- **Scalability**: System can scale horizontally to meet demand.
- **Maintainability**: Modular design simplifies debugging and updates.
- **Performance**: Distributed processing reduces bottlenecks during peak loads.

## ADR-002: Observability and Resilience

### **Context**
To ensure reliability, the pipeline must be able to handle errors gracefully, recover from failures, and provide visibility into its operations.

### **Decision**
- Implement centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms for all pipeline stages.
- Design error-handling mechanisms, including retries and detailed logging of failed operations.
- Incorporate metrics tracking for pipeline performance, such as latency, throughput, and error rates.

### **Consequences**
- **Reliability**: Robust error-handling ensures minimal disruption during failures.
- **Transparency**: Monitoring and logging provide clear insights into pipeline health.
- **Debugging**: Detailed error logs help identify and resolve issues quickly.
- **Proactive Management**: Alerts enable early intervention before issues escalate.

## ADR-003: Security and Compliance

### **Context**
The pipeline may processes both sensitive and open, publically available data by interacting with various external systems. But even if security concerns are minimal, the system must still ensure data integrity and reliability.

### **Decision**
- Use authentication and encryption for API endpoints and database connections.
- Sanitize and anonymize sensitive data during transformation where required.
- Maintain audit trails for all pipeline activities.
- Adhere to relevant regulations such as GDPR, depending on the data being processed.
- Enable workflows based on open data without compromising data integrity.

### **Consequences**
- **Security**: Protects against unauthorized access and data breaches while ensuring open data integrity where applicable.
- **Compliance**: Ensures adherence to legal requirements when processing sensitive data.
- **Accountability**: Audit trails provide traceability for all actions, regardless of the data's nature.
- **Flexibility**: Supports both secure and open data workflows.
- **Trust**: Demonstrates commitment to data privacy, security, and operational integrity.

## ADR-004: Workflow Automation and Orchestration

### **Context**
The pipeline must support complex workflows involving multiple dependencies and dynamic configurations to manage tasks efficiently.

### **Decision**
- Use an applcable workflow orchestration tools to manage ETL workflows.
- Automate retries, error handling, and task scheduling.
- Allow configuration-driven workflows defined in external files (e.g., YAML).

### **Consequences**
- **Efficiency**: Automation reduces manual intervention and speeds up processing.
- **Flexibility**: Config-driven workflows allow easy updates and customizations.
- **Reliability**: Automated retries and scheduling improve system uptime.
- **Scalability**: Orchestration tools handle growing complexity in workflows.

## ADR-005: Flexible Data Source and Target Support

### **Context**
The pipeline must interact with a wide variety of data sources (e.g., websites, APIs, databases) and targets (e.g., cloud storage, data warehouses, NoSQL stores).

### **Decision**
- Develop configurable connectors to support common data sources and targets.
- Include batch and real-time streaming capabilities.
- Ensure compatibility with cloud platforms and hybrid environments.

### **Consequences**
- **Versatility**: Supports a broad range of use cases.
- **Scalability**: Real-time and batch capabilities handle varying data needs.
- **Adaptability**: Compatibility with diverse environments ensures long-term usability.
- **Maintainability**: Configurable connectors reduce the need for hard-coded solutions.
