# Architectural Decision Record (ADR) for CentOps

## ADR-001: Notification and Callback Workflow

### **Context**
CentOps is responsible for notifying participants about updates, guidance, or required actions. Once notified, participants must call back to CentOps to retrieve the necessary details and initiate their workflows.

### **Decision**
- Notifications will be sent exclusively through secure API callbacks.
- Participants must call back to CentOps via the provided API endpoint to retrieve the latest technical manifests or guidance.
- CentOps will ensure that all necessary metadata is included in the callback responses to streamline participant workflows.

### **Consequences**
- **Simplicity**: Focuses exclusively on secure, machine-to-machine communication.
- **Autonomy**: Participants manage their workflows after receiving updates from CentOps.
- **Traceability**: Logs of notifications and callbacks ensure a detailed audit trail.
- **Security**: Restricts communication to authenticated API interactions.

## ADR-002: Manifest Distribution with Version Control

### **Context**
Participants need technical manifests containing update details, guides, or configurations. These manifests must be securely version-controlled and accessible only to validated participants.

### **Decision**
- Manifests will be provided in YAML or JSON format.
- Version control will be applied to all manifests to track changes.
- Access to manifests will be restricted to validated participants using secure authentication.

### **Consequences**
- **Security**: Restricted access ensures only validated participants can retrieve manifests.
- **Traceability**: Version control provides a clear history of changes.
- **Accessibility**: Standardized formats ensure compatibility with participant systems.

## ADR-003: Participant Autonomy for Updates and Maintenance

### **Context**
Participants must initiate updates or maintenance scripts independently, using provided manifests or scripts. CentOps will provide actionable instructions to ensure processes are clear.

### **Decision**
- Participants will be responsible for initiating updates or maintenance scripts.
- Clear, actionable instructions will accompany all manifests or scripts.
- CentOps will not directly execute updates or scripts on participant systems.

### **Consequences**
- **Empowerment**: Participants retain control over their own systems.
- **Simplicity**: Reduces the need for CentOps to manage participant environments.
- **Reliability**: Success of updates depends on participant adherence to provided instructions.

## ADR-004: Centralized Collection of Technical System Logs

### **Context**
Participants must send non-sensitive technical system logs to CentOps for centralized analysis. Logs will provide insights for troubleshooting and optimization while ensuring privacy.

### **Decision**
- Participants can send technical system logs to CentOps for analysis.
- Logs will be limited to non-sensitive data to protect participant privacy.
- Logs will be securely transmitted and stored.

### **Consequences**
- **Insightful Analysis**: Centralized logs provide valuable data for troubleshooting and system optimization.
- **Privacy**: Limiting logs to non-sensitive data ensures compliance with privacy requirements.
- **Collaboration**: Participants must configure systems to send logs appropriately.

---

## ADR-005: Monitoring and Reporting of CentOps Interactions

### **Context**
CentOps needs basic monitoring to track participant connectivity and interaction success rates. The system must avoid storing sensitive or personal information.

### **Decision**
- Implement basic monitoring for participant connectivity and callback success rates.
- Avoid storing sensitive or personal information.
- Use aggregated and anonymized data for reporting and insights.

### **Consequences**
- **Transparency**: Monitoring provides visibility into system performance and participant interactions.
- **Privacy**: Excludes sensitive data to ensure compliance with privacy standards.
- **Limited Scope**: Monitoring focuses only on connectivity and interactions.

## ADR-006: Authentication and Authorization for CentOps

### **Context**
Secure communication and access control are essential for protecting manifests, logs, and interactions with CentOps.

### **Decision**
- Use mutual TLS for secure communication between CentOps and participants.
- Require token-based authentication for API interactions.
- Implement role-based or attribute-based access control.

### **Consequences**
- **Security**: Strong authentication and access control mechanisms protect data and communication.
- **Flexibility**: Role-based access enables fine-grained control.
- **Overhead**: Requires regular token and certificate rotation.

---

## ADR-007: Data Protection for Manifests and Logs

### **Context**
Manifests and logs must be encrypted in transit and at rest to ensure data protection.

### **Decision**
- Encrypt manifests and logs in transit using HTTPS.
- Encrypt data at rest using industry-standard encryption techniques.
- Avoid storing sensitive information or unnecessary details in logs.

### **Consequences**
- **Security**: Ensures confidentiality and integrity of manifests and logs.
- **Compliance**: Aligns with data protection standards.
- **Efficiency**: Requires robust encryption mechanisms.

---

## ADR-008: High Availability and Reliability of CentOps

### **Context**
CentOps must remain operational even during failures or high loads. The system must be fault-tolerant and scalable.

### **Decision**
- Design CentOps as a distributed, fault-tolerant system.
- Use Kubernetes to handle varying loads.
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed notifications or manifest deliveries.

### **Consequences**
- **Availability**: Ensures uptime during failures or scaling events.
- **Performance**: Autoscaling adjusts resources based on demand.
- **Complexity**: Distributed systems and autoscaling add operational overhead.

---

## ADR-009: Automated Deployment and Maintenance

### **Context**
Consistent and repeatable deployments are critical for maintaining CentOps and participant systems.

### **Decision**
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Helm) for deploying CentOps.
- Provide participants with deployment scripts for their own Kubernetes clusters.
- Regularly update CentOps dependencies and container images.

### **Consequences**
- **Consistency**: IaC ensures predictable deployments.
- **Scalability**: Scripts simplify participant deployments across diverse environments.
- **Operational Overhead**: Requires maintaining IaC configurations and participant scripts.

---

## ADR-010: Granular Manifest Access Control

### **Context**
CentOps needs to manage access to manifests based on the scope of applicability, ensuring that updates or guidance can be targeted to all participants, a specific group, or an individual instance.

### **Decision**
- Manifests can be designated for:
  - **All participants**: Updates applicable universally.
  - **Groups of participants**: Updates relevant to specific clusters or types of instances.
  - **Specific participants**: Updates tailored for individual instances.
- Access control will be implemented using role-based or attribute-based policies.
- Metadata in the manifests will include the intended scope to prevent unauthorized use.

### **Consequences**
- **Flexibility**: Enables targeted updates, reducing unnecessary data distribution.
- **Security**: Ensures that only the intended participants can access and apply the manifest.
- **Complexity**: Requires robust access control mechanisms and metadata validation.
